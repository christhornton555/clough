# clough
A way to convert Excel .xlsx files to web pages

"**clough**" is pronounced "cluff"

The easy way to remember this is that "plow" doesn't rhyme with "glow"; it sounds like "plough", and "plough" doesn't rhyme with "clough" because "clough" rhymes with "tough" which rhymes with "stuff"

**clough** will insert the spreadsheet you specify into a template webpage of your choice. Just add the tag **\<!-- #CLOUGH -->** to the HTML template where you want the table to be inserted.
